 * Improve the clear current line function (A-c): make it no print a new line.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.27.1
 * Add archive support: Use 'atool' to compress/decompress and 'archivemount' (AUR)
	to mount.
 * Add support for custom resource opener
 * Bulk rename. The 'fff' FM copy all selected filenames to a file, open
	a text editor to edit them, and then rename the original files. NICE.
 * Allow reverse sorting order.
 * Add mtime, btime, atime, and version to the sorting function.
 * Add different sorting methods: none, name, (c)time, size
 * Print some tip at startup, like MC does.
 * Prevent the _err function from storing consecutive equal messages.
 * Add a light mode to list files faster. Include config file option, command
	and a keyboard shortcut.
 * Add a dir counter to symlinks to directory.
 * List symlinks pointing to directories as directories when listing files.
 * Add an option to share (or not) the selection box among profiles.
 * Non-executable files should not be added to paths (that is, not available for
	commands tab-completion).
 * Allow get_properties() to recognize the existence of ACL properties,
	like 'ls -l' does via the plus sign.
 * TMP_DIR should not be /tmp/clifm, since this is common to all users, 
	in which case network mounpoint could be overwritten. It should be rather
	/tmp/clifm/user.
 * Add an option to disable the dir counter, since this feature could
	slow things down too much when listing files on a remote server.
 * Add network support for SSH, SMB, and FTP mounts. Use sshfs, 
	mount.cifs, and curlftpfs, for SSH, SMB, and FTP respectivelly.
 * Add an option to disable files sorting.
 * Write a better color code check (is_color()).
 * Remove VLA's (variable length arrays)
 * Comment the config file to explain the meaning of each option and 
	value, something like the SSH and Samba config files.
 * Add to "bm del" the possibility to specify the bookmark name to be
	deleted directly from the command line ("bm del name").
 * The commands log function should be disabled by default.
 * Log the literal command entered by the user, and not 
	the expanded version.
 * Remove user from the logs line: it's redundant.
 * Add ranges support for 'trash del'.
 * Add aliases for commands TAB completion.
 * Add prompt customization.
 * Add file extension support to the mime function.
 * If the MIME file doesn't exist, do not create an empty one, but try to import the values from the 'mimeapps.list' file.
 * Add the possibility to open files in the background when no 
	application has been passed (ex: o xx &).
 * Port to FreeBSD.
 * Port to ARM machines.
 * The logic of bookmarks and copy functions is crap! Rewrite it.
 * Add TAB completion for bookmarks.
 * Set the LS_COLORS environment	variable to use CliFM colors for TAB completion.
 * Do not allow the user to trash some stupid thing like a block or a character device.
 * Bookmarks: replace "hotkey" by "Shortcut".
 * Allow the bookmarks function to add or remove bookmarks from the command line: "bm add PATH".
 * Allow mixed use of sequential and conditional commands.
 * Add support for commands conditional and sequential execution.
 * Add ranges to deselect and undel functions.
 * Disable TAB completion when in bookmarks, mountpoints, undel or desel functions.
 * Add an argument, -P, to use an alternative profile.
 * Allow the use of ANSI color codes for prompt, ELN's and text color.
 * Add the possibility to customize filetypes colors.
 * Use default values if no config file is found.
 * Fix calls to calloc to avoid wasting resources.
 * Replace the dirlist dirent struct by a simple array of string.
 * Add ELN auto-expansion.
 * Use gettext to make the program tanslatable to any language
 * Add to the properties function the ability list properties for more
	than one file: "pr 1 2-5 10".
 * Add to the search function the ability to search for files in any
	directory specified by the user: "/str /path".
 * Remove the -c argument (run command and exit): it's a remaining of
	the old shell version of this program.
 * The errors system can display not only errors, but also warnings, 
	like in the case of modifiyng ~/.Xresources, and any kind of message. 
	Replace the red "E" in the prompt by three different colors and letters: 
	red "E" for errors, yellow "W" for warnings, and green "N" for simple 
	notifications, hints, and so on. I should also modify the log_errors() 
	function and other variables to reflect this change.
 * Add a pager for the long view mode
 * Add a long view mode (or info mode) for files listing
 * Add keybindings for some basic operations: u-j-h-k for filesystem
	navigation.

	the command line. Added directly in parse_input_str().
 * Add a trash function. 
 * Add some kind of pager to list directories with large amount of 
	files.
 * Use const for functions parameters if these parameters won't be 
	modified by the function.
 * Add a forward function as a complement to the back() function.
 * User defined variables only works for the CLiFM shell. Make it work 
	for the system shell as well, it's a nice feature.
 * Get rid of the DEFAULT_PATH macro
 * Let folders-first, show-hidden, and list-on-the-fly as default. Add 
	command line options to enable AND to disable these features.

 * Make the 'back' function remember more paths.

 * Add ranges to the selection function.
