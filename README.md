## :space_invader: Brief description

**Clifm** is a shell-like, text-based terminal file manager that sits on the command line.

Though fully-featured, powerful, and extensible, it is not so much about features, but about design, about the way in which you interact with your file system.

Most terminal file managers out there (if not all) are built using the **TUI** design principles, much like the superb `Midnight Commander` and `Ranger`. But **clifm** is built rather having the **CLI** design principles in mind: do not navigate through a big menu of files, **just type it!**, exactly as you do in your regular shell, but easier and faster.

For this reason, **clifm** does not need to be better: it's **just different!** :wink:

For a detailed description consult the [introductory section](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Introduction#what-is-clifm) of our Wiki.

<!--
Unlike most terminal file managers out there, indeed, **clifm** replaces the traditional TUI interface (also known as curses or text-menu based interface) by a command-line interface (CLI),<sup>1</sup> also known as REPL.<sup>2</sup>

If working with the command-line, your workflow is not affected at all, but just enriched with file management functionalities: automatic files listing, files selection, bookmarks, tags, directory jumper, directory and commands history, auto-cd and auto-open, bulk rename, TAB completion, autosuggestions, and a trash system, among [other features](#features). In this sense, **clifm** is certainly a file manager, but also a shell extension.

Briefly put, with **clifm** the command-line is always already there, never hidden :godmode: :muscle:

## :bulb: Getting started

To start using **clifm** _you don't need to learn anything new_: the usual shell commands will just work. However, there is much more than just shell commands... \
✓ The `help` command gives you a quick introduction to **clifm**: once in the **clifm** prompt, enter `help` or `?`. \
✓ Type `cmd<TAB>` to get the list of available commands and a brief description (since version 1.9.2). \
✓ Type `help <TAB>` to get the list of available _help topics_. Select the one you want and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. \
✓ To jump into the **COMMANDS** section in the [manpage](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/blob/master/misc/clifm.1.pdf), simply enter `cmd` or press <kbd>F2</kbd>. \
✓ Press <kbd>F1</kbd> to access the full manpage and <kbd>F3</kbd> to access the keybindings help-page. \
✓ To get help about some specific command just type `CMD -h`. For instance, `s -h`.

You can also take a look at some of both our [FAQ](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/FAQ) and these [basic usage-examples](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Common-Operations#basic-usage-examples) to get you started. \

## :newspaper: What's new?
<details>
<summary>Click here to expand</summary>

* `version 1.11 (Cobb)`
  - Files apparent size is used now by default. Revert via `--no-apparent-size` or setting `ApparentSize` to `false` in the config file. 
  - **NEW**: [**Clifm** will try to run in 256 colors mode if support is detected](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Customization#color-support). Just comment out the `ColorScheme` option in the config file (or set it either to an empty value or to `default-256`) to enable this feature.
  - **NEW**: [Mark files with extended attributes (long view)](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Common-Operations#longdetail-view-mode)
  - **NEW**: [Customizable timestamps, including relative times (long view)](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Common-Operations#time-styles)
  - **NEW**: [Color gradients for file sizes and timestamps (long view)](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Common-Operations#file-details)
  - **NEW**: [Use `config dump` to print the list of settings and their current value (highlighting those differing from default values)](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Introduction#config-reset-dump-application)
  - The [`config` command](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Introduction#config-reset-application) is now used to open/edit the main configuration file (`edit` can still be used, but is deprecated and might be removed in a future release)
  - `FzfPreview` (file previews in TAB completion - fzf mode only) is now enabled by default (disable via `--no-fzfpreview`)
  - Improved jump table screen (via the [`j` command](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Introduction#j---purge-num---edit-jc-jl-jp-str--jo-num-je))
  - [Purge the jump database via the `--purge` option](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Introduction#j---purge-num---edit-jc-jl-jp-str--jo-num-je)
* `version 1.10 (Swordmaster)`:
  - [Quickly access the directory history list via the `dh` command](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Introduction#dh-string-path-eln). The `dh` plugin, just as the `bh` and `fh` commands, is now deprecated.
  - [History timestamps](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Introduction#history-edit-clear--n-on-off-status-show-time)
  - `s:` works now like `sel` keyword, to be in line with `t:` (for tags) and `b:` (for bookmarks). Consult the [Files selection](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Common-Operations#selection) section.
  - The `:b` construct was removed. `b:` now lists bookmark names instead of paths. `b:mybm` expands to the path pointed to by the bookmark named `mybm`. The `ExpandBookmarks` option (config file) is now deprecated, just as the bookmarks suggestions strategy (in the `SuggestionStrategy` option). See the [Bookmarks](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Common-Operations#bookmarks) section.
  - Bookmarks can be created directly from the command line, without an interactive prompt: `bm add FILE BM_NAME`.
  - [Rename profiles via the `rename` subcommand](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Introduction#pf-prof-profile-ls-list-set-add-del-profile-rename-profile-new_name)
  - [`oc`, a files ownership editor](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Introduction#oc-elnfile-)
  - Get list of commands and a brief description via `cmd<TAB>` 
  - [Suggest a brief description for internal commands](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Specifics#auto-suggestions)
  - Set a custom selections file via the `--sel-file` flag
* `version 1.9 (Sharptooth)`:
  - [Improved fuzzy suggestions/completions for file names and paths](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Specifics#auto-suggestions)
  - [Automatic expansion for bookmarks, file type, and MIME type filters](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Advanced#grouping-files-via-automatic-expansion)
  - [Private workspace settings](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Specifics#workspace-settings)
  - [Run autocommands based on workspaces, and not just on paths](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Specifics#autocommands)
  - [Run the pager based on the current amount of files](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Introduction#pg-pager-on-off-status-num)
  - Files counter for directories in long view mode
  - [Filter files by file type](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Introduction#ft-filter-unset-regexfile-type-char)
  - [Filter files by MIME type](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Advanced/#quickly-filtering-files-with-the-tab-key)
  - [`pc`, a file permissions editor](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Introduction#pc-elnfile-)
  - `cd -` works now just like in most shells
  - The [`view` command](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Introduction#view-edit-app) can now select files via <kbd>TAB</kbd>

  - Use `--fzfpreview-hidden` to start the preview window hidden (toggle via <kbd>Alt-p</kbd>)
* `version 1.8 (Otis)`:
  - If upgrading from a previous version (optional, but recommended):
    - <kbd>F7</kbd> opens now shotgun's configuration file (instead of the jump database file). Update `keybindings.clifm`: removing the file and restarting is enough. Manually: run `kb edit` and then replace `open-jump-db:\e[18~` by `open-preview:\e[18~`.
    - New specific options to control the files preview window. Add the following options to the `FzfTabOptions` line in your theme file (via the `cs edit` command) or just copy the theme file from the data directory (usually `/usr/local/share/clifm/colors`): `--bind alt-p:toggle-preview,change:top,alt-up:preview-page-up,alt-down:preview-page-down --preview-window=wrap,border-left --color="border:7:dim"`.
  - [`clifmimg` plugin, for image previews](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/tree/master/misc/tools/imgprev#image-previews)
  - [`view` command, to preview files in full screen](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Introduction#view-edit-app)
  - [TAB completion with file previews](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Specifics#tab-completion-with-file-previews)
  - [Shotgun, a built-in files previewer](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Advanced#shotgun)

  - Flat-view for the [`fzfsel` plugin](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Advanced#plugins) via the `-f` option
  - [Improved VT100 compatibility via the `--vt100` switch](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Extra#clifm-running-on-a-dec-vt100-terminal-1978)
  - [Cygwin support](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Introduction#small_blue_diamond-d-cygwin)
  - Improved performance/portability of the suggestions system: no more slow/non-portable `CPR`-`CUP` [escape sequences](https://www.xfree86.org/current/ctlseqs.html)! These were replaced by 100% made in-house cursor position calculation plus basic/portable escape sequences: `CUU`, `CUD`, `CUF`, and `CUB`.
* `version 1.7 (Elaine)`:
  - [Configuration files renamed from `.cfm` to `.clifm`](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Specifics#new-extension-for-configuration-files) (avoid conflict with [ColdFusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion_Markup_Language) files)
  - <kbd>Ctrl-l</kbd> added for screen refresh
  - `cc` command removed to avoid conflicts with `/bin/cc` (use `colors` instead)
  - `--std-tab-comp` option renamed to `--stdtab` (to match `--fzytab` and `--smenutab` options)
* `version 1.6 (Guybrush)`:
  - ELN's color defaults now to cyan
  - `--no-folders-first` and `--folders-first` options renamed to `--no-dirs-first` and `--dirs-first` respectively. In the same way, the `folders-first` command was renamed to `dirs-first`.
  - `PromptStyle` option renamed as `Notifications` (taking `true` and `false` as values)
* `version 1.5 (Nano)`:
  - `Prompt`, `WarningPromptStr`, `DividingLine`, and `FfzTabOptions` options were moved from the config file to the color scheme file to get a **centralized and single theming file**. However, to keep backwards compatibility, the old location is still recognized. If any of these options is found in the color scheme file, values taken from the main configuration file will be overriden.
  - The [warning prompt](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Customization#the-warning-prompt) color is set now via escape codes (exactly as the regular prompt). The `wp` color code is used now only for the _input text color_ of the warning prompt.
* `version 1.4 (Alma)`:
  - In order to make _Lira_ more powerful (it can now match entire file names instead of just file extensions) it was necessary to introduce [a little syntax modification](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Specifics#syntax) in its configuration file.
